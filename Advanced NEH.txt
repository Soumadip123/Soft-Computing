Method 2

1. Find the SEED sequence in non increasing order of makespan.
2. Select first 4 jobs from SEED sequence and permute them to have 4! partial sequences.
3. Select M (<=4!) best sequences.
4. Set k = 5
5. Insert kth job from SEED in each of the M sequences to get M*k number of partial sequences.
6. Select M best sequences.
7. Set k = k+1 and go to step 5 if k<=n
8. Output best sequence and corresponding makespan
